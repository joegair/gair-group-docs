# gair-group-docs
This project contains the code for [gair-group-docs](https://joegair.github.io/gair-group-docs/), which hosts documents and tutorials of use to the Gair group in the department of chemistry at Michigan State University.

The site was created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
and uses the [Just-the-Docs theme](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) 
adapted from [CREST-docs](https://github.com/crest-lab/crest-docs)
