  - cmd: --splitfile <FILE> [from] [to]
    type: Ensemble file splitting
    descript: >
      Split an ensemble from `<FILE>` into separate directories for each structure. 
      `[from]` and `[to]` can optionally be used to select specific structures from 
      the file or a range of structures. The new directories are collected in a 
      directory called SPLIT.

  - cmd: --reactor
    type: xTB nanoreactor setup
    descript: >
      This function provides a utility function to set up an xTB nanoreactor calculation
      as specified in [JCTC, 2019, 15, 2847-2862.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b00143).
      For instructions on how to use it see 
      [Example: xTB Nanoreactor](../examples/utilities/utils_6.html).


constrainment:

  - cmd: --cinp <FILE>
    descript: >
      Specify a `<FILE>` with additional constraints in the xTB syntax.

  - cmd: --constrain <atomlist>
    descript: >
      Set up an example file in which the atoms in `<atom list>` shall be constrained. 
      The file will be called `.xcontrol.sample`. No calculations will be performed and
      the run is aborted after this sample is written. The written file can be read 
      with the `--cinp` option. 
      For specifications on the `atomlist` format 
      see the [**Input Formats**](coords.html#atomlists) section.

  - cmd: --cbonds [REAL]
    descript: >
      Set up a constraint on all bonds (as detected in the input coordinates topology),
      where `[REAL]` optionally can be used to set the force constant 
      (default value 0.02 *E*<sub>h</sub>).

  - cmd: --nocbonds
    descript: >
      Turn off `-cbonds` (mainly for GFN-FF)

  - cmd: --cmetal [REAL]
    descript: >
      Set up a constraint on all M-X bonds (as detected in the input coordinates, 
      M = transition metal atom), where `[REAL]` optionally can be used to set the 
      force constant (default value 0.02 *E*<sub>h</sub>)

  - cmd: --cheavy [REAL]
    descript: >
      Set up a constraint on all heavy atom bonds (*i.e.*, X-H bonds will be 
      not constrained), where `[REAL]` optionally can be used to set the 
      force constant (default value 0.02 *E*<sub>h</sub>)

  - cmd: --clight [REAL]
    descript: >
      Set up a constraint on all X-H bonds (as detected in the input 
      coordinates), where `[REAL]` optionally can be used to set the
      force constant (default value 0.02 *E*<sub>h</sub>)

  - cmd: --fc <REAL>
    descript: >
      Specify a force constant for the applied constraints (default
      value 0.02 *E*<sub>h</sub>). 
      Note: Only one force constant is applied for all constraints!
