    "content": "The conformations of alpha-diazo carbonyl compounds have important implications for their reactivity. In some systems it has been demonstrated that the cis isomer undergoes a concerted Wolff rearragnement upon nitrogen extrusion, whereas the trans isomer yields an intermediate carbene which can engage in intermolecular chemistry. Therefore, before designing a reaction to proceed through the intermediacy of an alpha-carbonyl carbene, one might seek to characterize the distribution of cis and trans isomers of the diazo precursor at equilibrium. The equilibrium constants (Keq) for cis-trans isomerism of diazoacetone and methyl diazoacetate were previously measured by low temperature NMR (JACS 1966, 950–956). Notably, the ketone is predominantly cis whereas the ester is a nearly equal mixture of cis and trans. If we did not have these experimental results, could we have predicted this with DFT? . The short answer is, yes. The tables below give the experimental and computed free energies for cis-to-trans isomerism of diazoacetone and methyl diazoacetate, as well as the values of Keq at -40 °C (experimental conditions) and the portion of each isomer at equilibrium. Density functional theory acurately predicts that the cis isomer is preferred for the ketone (diazoacetone) whereas isomerism is approximately thermoneutral for the ester (methyl diazoacetate). | molecule | source | ΔG | Keq | % cis | % trans | . | diazoacetone | exp. | 1.2 | 0.08 | 92% | 8% | . | diazoacetone | DFT | 0.7 | 0.22 | 82% | 18% | . | methyl diazoacetate | exp. | &lt;0.1 | 0.9 | 54% | 46% | . | methyl diazoacetate | DFT | 0.1 | 0.8 | 56% | 44% | .

In the screenshot above you can see the first page of the QM input interface. We’ve selected ORCA as the file type.

Our stucture from the 2D builder is selected by it’s default name ‘new’. There are several sub-menus that are relevant to setting up our job. The setup for this calculation is illustrated graphically and described in more detail below. Job Details . The charge is 0 for our neutral molecule. The multiplicity is 1 because we are looking at the singlet state. We’ve selected the boxes for geometry optimization and frequency calculation. We include the frequency calculation to ensure that the geometry that results from our optimization is a true local minimum (no negative frequencies). For local calculations 1 processor and 1 GB of memory is adequate. We can also select the ‘solvent’ sub-menu to set an implicit solvation model. I’ve opted for the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). No changes are needed in the optimization settings or frequency settings for this job. Method . For simplicity, we’ll opt for the most generic method in DFT, B3LYP with Grimme’s damped dispersion correction. Neither the most efficient nor the most accurate method, but totally fine for our purposes. Basis Functions . Here we’ll opt for a balanced, modern basis set, def2-svp. Additional Options . It is often helpful to use tight SCF convergence criteria when performing a frequency calculation in order to mininimize numerical noise that can lead to spurious imaginary frequencies.

    "content": "The options in this section are used to modify the CREGEN sorting algorithm, in both the standalone version (--cregen &lt;FILE&gt;) and tied in to the conformational sampling. An application of the standalone CREGEN application is shown in Example 2. | Command | Description | . | --ewin &lt;REAL&gt; | Set the energy threshold to &lt;REAL&gt; kcal/mol.

Currently unused. | . | --nmr, --eqv | Activate determination and printout of NMR-equivalencies for the ensemble. Writes the files anmr_rotamer and anmr_nucinfo, which are required by the CENSO python script. | . | --athr &lt;REAL&gt; | Similarity threshold to determine internal rotation of equal atoms for NMR (to be used in conjunction with --nmr). The [default] is 0.04. | . | --temp &lt;REAL&gt; | Temperature used for Boltzmann populations in CREGEN. The [default] is 298.15 K. | . | --esort | Sort only based on energy, i.e., no RMSD and rotational constant comparison. | . | --nowr | Skip writing new ensemble files (crest_rotamers_*.xyz, crest_conformers.xyz). | . | --subrmsd | Compare only those parts of the structure that were also included in the metadynamics bias potential. Can be important for constrained conformational searches. See Example 4. | . | --notopo [atomlist] | Turn off the topology checks in CREGEN for structures in the ensemble. The optional [atomlist] argument can be used to select specific atoms that should be ignored in the topology checks. For the atomlist format see the Input Formats section. Do not confuse with --noreftopo | . | --wall,--wallxl,--wallxxl | Automatically set up a wall potential (3 different sizes are available) for the calculation, independent of any NCI mode. | . PCA Clustering Options . An extension to the CREGEN sorting is an automatic principle component analysis (PCA) and k-Means sorting clustering algorithm. It can be invoked with the --cluster command.  Tip: The --cluster option serves as an extension for regular conformational searches, the --cregen &lt;FILE&gt; standalone usage, or the --for &lt;FILE&gt; command and can be used with any of these. Note: This algorithm currently does not work well for non-covalent complexes or molecular clusters and should only be applied to singular molecules. | Command | Description | . | --cluster [ARG] | Perform a clustering on an ensemble to identify the most representative structures, based on dihedral angles. [ARG] is an unspecified optional argument. If [ARG] is an integer, e.g., [ARG]=5, that many clusters will be produced. If [ARG] is omitted, the routine will try to determine the best number of clusters by itself. This autonomous mode can also be accessed with different setting if [ARG] is an of loose, normal, tight, or vtight. Here, cluster sizes are tested one-by-one, which can be expensive for large ensembles. To speed things up, some incremental variants are accessible via incr, tightincr, and vtightincr. The [default], i.e., omitting [ARG], corresponds to --cluster normal. See also Example: Conformational Entropy. | . | --pccap &lt;INT&gt; | Limit the number of automatically identified principle components to the &lt;INT&gt; most contributing ones. | . | --nopcmin | Remove lower bound for principal component contribution, i.e., more principle components might be considerd for the clustering. | . | --pcaex &lt;atomlist&gt; | Ignore atoms listed in &lt;atomlist&gt; in principle component setup.
