This tutorial will demonstrate how to get a high performance computing (HPC) account at MSU, how to get access to ORCA and Gaussian on HPC, and how to submit DFT calculations on HPC. The tutorial aims to be accessible to folks with no coding experience. Download a pdf of the tutorial [here](https://github.com/joegair/gair-group-docs/tree/main/assets/data/20240410_first_hpc_job/download).
