## MSU Proxy Bookmarklet
Accessing journal articles away from campus is not convenient. MSU offers [resources](https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/c.php?g=917727&p=6614013) for remote access, but these tools are not super easy if you are trying to follow a link to new journal article on your phone. Below are instructions to create a [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) that converts the current URL to the MSU proxy URL (access to campus web resources from anywhere). I'm providing instructions and screenshots for how to do this on a phone because that is where this tool has been the most useful for me. The same bookmarklet can be installed and used in basically the same way in any browser on any device (I use this tool regularly on my laptop).

[msuEZproxyTEST](javascript:void(location.href='https://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=%27+location.href);)
{: .text-justify }


- navigate to any webpage (using google.com in this example)
- bookmark the page
- edit the bookmark's name (here I'm naming it msuEZproxy, the name you choose doesn't impact function)
- edit the address of the bookmark to read `javascript:void(location.href='https://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=%27+location.href);`

You've created a bookmarklet!
