## Calculating Cartesian RMSDs

The calculation of Cartesian RMSDs as a standalone tool in CREST is straight-forward with the `--rmsd <FILE1> <FILE2>` option.
Assuming the two structures to be compared are named `struc1.xyz` and `struc2.xyz`, the CREST command would be
{: .test-justify }

```bash
crest --rmsd struc1.xyz struc2.xyz
```


which produces the outcome

{% capture crest_output %}

 Command line input:
 > crest --rmsd struc1.xyz struc2.xyz

 Calculated RMSD (Å):      1.48259461
{% endcapture %}
{% include codecell.html content=crest_output style="font-size:10px" %}

The RMSD will always be printed in Å, regardless of the input file format of `<FILE1>` and `<FILE2>`.
Since the RMSD is printed as the last line of this CREST printout, it can easily be 
read from the command line (e.g. for scripting purposes)
{: .text-justify }
```bash
crest --rmsd struc1.xyz struc2.xyz | tail -1
```
